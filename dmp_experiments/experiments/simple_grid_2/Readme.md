# Simple Grid 2 Experiment

This experiment demonstrates metric computation within a Keras model's fit function using callbacks. To run the expertiment, first install the DMP python environment. Then,

`python run_experiment.py`

This will create a saved_models directory with experimental results.

See `analyze_results.ipynb` for data analysis and visualization.
